What is Whirleygig?
-------------------
Whirleygig is a puzzle game I've been working on independently for some time, a few years. It's a unique spin on a pipe connection game, I think one that promises to be very engaging. Its has good variety of game play, and the foundation is there for more and more interesting powerups & mechanics to be put in place.


How do I try it? What's the deal with the Test tracks? 
-------------------------------------
Whirley is starting with a both a open Beta and closed Alpha.  The closed Alpha is sometimes unstable but has the lastest and greatest.  If you're asking for a change and want to see it quickly, this is the best track to be on.  


How do I join the Closed Alpha?
-------------------------------
There's plenty of room in the closed Alpha so simply email whirleygiggame@gmail.com (include the Google account you use to login to the Play store if its not your normal contact) and I'll get you onboard.  You'll be added to the tester's Google Group and receive a link to opt-in to 'Internal Testing'.  The closed Alpha is distributed with this 'Internal Test' feature on Google Play.

How do I join the Open Beta?
----------------------------
Just click the following Google Play link to get access to the Beta track:
